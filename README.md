Java Maven Errorprone Compiler Configuration Demo
=================================================

Why this project?
-----------------

You might think that configuring another Java compiler in Maven would be
trivial. I certainly expected it to be, but that turned out to be an
unwarranted assumption, and given that I had spent much more time than I
had anticipated, I thought that I would explain what I experienced so
that others might gain from what I had stumbled upon.
